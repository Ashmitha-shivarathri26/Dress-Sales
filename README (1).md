## Overall Learning 

During my internship with Sure Trust, I had a valuable learning experience where I worked on creating a Dress Sales Dashboard using SQL and Power BI. This project helped me understand how to collect, analyze, and visualize data effectively to derive meaningful business insights. I gained hands-on experience in writing SQL queries, cleaning and organizing data, and designing interactive dashboards in Power BI.

I would like to sincerely thank my mentor Sravan Sir for his constant guidance, clear explanations, and support throughout the project, which played a key role in helping me build strong technical understanding and confidence. This internship significantly improved my analytical thinking and practical skills, and encouraged me to apply data-driven approaches in real-world scenarios.

Overall, LST and SST training supported my personal growth and prepared me to handle real-world challenges with a positive and professional approach.

Overall, the community service component added meaningful value to the internship by helping me grow as a responsible individual alongside my technical learning.
